Taxonomies are a way to label and organize the posts on your site.

WordPress has two default taxonomies:

- **Categories**: The top level categories used to organize content on your site.  

- **Tags**: Keywords or topics used to group related posts together on a more micro level. For example, you might have a category called "Politics" and posts in that category might have tags like "Campaign Finance", "Election 2012", etc.

In addition to these two taxonomies, Largo adds three more:

- **Post Prominence**: This is used to determine which posts to display on the homepage or in featured posts widgets in the sidebar and footer. You might also add additional categories to this taxonomy to create custom feeds for distribution to content partners.

- **Series**: If you add a post to a multi-part series, you should create a category in the Series taxonomy from the edit post screen and make sure all posts in that series have this label applied. That way the Largo theme knows to display other posts in that series at the bottom of posts and, in some cases, on the homepage.

- **Post Types** (new in version 0.4): Post types are a way of labeling posts with a particular type, such as "Data reporting" or "Transcripts." Each post type can have an icon, which will be used in certain places in the theme. Each post type also has its own archive.

You can add posts to any of these taxonomies from the post edit screen. Adding new taxonomies is as simple as clicking "Add New Category" in that taxonomy's section in the post editor.

For consistency, we recommend capitalizing every word in tags, categories and custom taxonomies (so: "My Favorite Series" not "My favorite series" and "Campaign Finance" not "campaign finance").

NOTE: You may need to click on "Screen Options" at the very top of the post edit screen to ensure that all of the taxonomy editors are visible.

## Categories

We recommend using no more than 8 to 12 categories for your content. Think about the top level buckets you might use to group your content and how visitors might browse your site. Topic-based categories tend to be more useful than content types (so, "Politics" is more meaningful to a first-time visitor than "Investigations").
